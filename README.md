# SnackGame
SnackGame is a simple Java application that simulates a snack-eating game. 
The objective of the game is to control a snack (such as a snake) and navigate it through a grid, eating snacks and avoiding obstacles.
Features
Grid-based gameplay with a snack that moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
Randomly generated snacks that the player must consume to earn points.
Obstacles that the player must avoid, as collision with an obstacle leads to game over.
Increasing difficulty as the player's score increases.
High score tracking and display

Usage
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate the snack through the grid.
Try to eat as many snacks as possible to earn points and increase your score.
Avoid collisions with obstacles, as they will end the game.
The game ends when the snack collides with an obstacle or the game window is closed.
